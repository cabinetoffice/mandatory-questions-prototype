            The Test Grant for Prototyping (TGP) offers no funding. It exists for the purpose of testing the Find a Grant service, and does not exist on the real Find a Grant website. The scheme was re-launched in June 2023 to enable more people to trial the prototype and help learn more about how people approach and feel about the experience of applying for a grant.
